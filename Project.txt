This is the problem statement for project:- 
The project is to develop an app for booking vehicles like OLA, Uber. You have to use Python as the  main language to write code. Show the complete workflow diagram of your proposed methodology for vehicle booking along with a live example. You can use any machine learning algorithm which makes your task easier (like k-Means clustering algorithm).

Setup:-
	1. Unzip Tonga.zip and install below
	2. Install below packages
		pip3 install jupyterlab
		pip3 install seaborn
		pip3 install scikit-learn
		pip3 install pyproj
	3. Install tableplus (optional) 

Steps to run the code:- 
	1. Open Terminal/Window and cd <unzipped location>/Tonga
	2. Run "jupyter lab" from command line 
	3. Open Tonga.ipynb file in jupyter notebook by double click and run all the code
		User:		user@tonga.com , password: welcome
	4. Manager.ipynb 
		Manager: 	admin@tonga.com , password: admin
	5. Driver.ipynb 
		Driver: 	driver@tonga.com, password: welcome
	6. FarePrediction.ipynb
		Main program for Fare Prediction


Further enhancements:-
	1. Convert address to latitude and longitude
	2. Season (spring, summer, fall, winter)
	3. Holiday and workingday split
	4. Traffic conditions
	5. Combine with open data sources like weather data
